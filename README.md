# Pizza-Sales
## Description
This project aims to analyze pizza sales data using SQL to derive business insights, including customer preferences, revenue generation, and time-based order patterns. The analysis is divided into three levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced, and focuses on queries related to order volume, pizza categories, and revenue contributions.

## Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to help the business make data-driven decisions by:
- Understanding total sales and revenue
- Identifying the most popular pizza types and sizes
- Analyzing order distribution by time and pizza category
- Evaluating the contribution of each pizza to total revenue

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on pizza orders, including:
-Order_details
-orders
-pizza_types
-Pizzas

## SQL Analysis
The project consists of three levels of SQL queries:
- Retrieve total number of orders
- Calculate total revenue from pizza sales
- Identify the highest-priced pizza and the most common pizza size
- List the top 5 most ordered pizza types
- Find total quantities ordered by pizza category
- Analyze order distribution by hour of the day
- Calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day
- Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza to total revenue
- Track cumulative revenue over time
- Identify top 3 pizzas by revenue

 ## Conclusion
- This SQL data analysis project provides a detailed understanding of pizza sales trends, customer preferences, and revenue generation. By analyzing key metrics such as total orders, revenue, and the popularity of different pizza types and sizes, we gained valuable insights into the business’s performance. The intermediate and advanced analyses further deepened our understanding by revealing order patterns across time, category-wise distributions, and revenue contributions of specific pizzas.

These insights can be used to make data-driven decisions to improve inventory management, optimize staffing schedules, adjust pricing strategies, and target marketing efforts for high-revenue products. Ultimately, this project demonstrates the power of SQL in transforming raw data into meaningful information that can drive business growth and operational efficiency.
